# handoff.md

## Active Restart Session (2026-09-09)

- Request: check PR #48, triage P0, unify W/X candidates, review ADRs, and prepare spec-to-issues publication. Runtime implementation remains gated.
- Actual workspace: `/Users/yangseunghyeon/orca/workspaces/OnMaruBE/prd-planning`; branch `feature/backend-prd-planning`; starting HEAD `2548b42`.
- PR #48 is MERGED into `develop`; head `665a01d5e100b097c9f62c58bb1b368599a866b2`. CI `verify` succeeded; `gemini-review` failed; CodeRabbit succeeded. Review decision field is empty, so human approval is not established by this query.
- This section supersedes the historical branch, PR creation, and restart instructions below. Preserve the merged planning commit; do not rewrite it or reuse its deleted work branch.
- Missing contest inputs and the two references were requested; keep them pending unless supplied.
- Current graph: 21 candidates, waves 0-9, no graph errors; five shared Gradle conflict warnings are intentionally serialized by the integration policy in `docs/planning/implementation-issues.md`.
- ADR-0002 records only the user-selected Spring Boot business API / FastAPI AI roles. D1-D4/E1-E5 remain proposals; review results are in `docs/planning/p0-triage.md`.
- External schema guide has uncommitted changes; metadata alone is not a reproducible snapshot. FE specs are clean at the recorded source commit.
- No GitHub Issues were created, no runtime scaffold started, no push or new PR performed.
- Tracking Issue #49 was created for this planning follow-up PR. No runtime scaffold started.
- Next: resolve scope/reference inputs and W0 security/snapshot/architecture gates; review the concrete `implementation-issues.md` publication draft; publish and verify native Issue relationships before starting implementation.

## Session Snapshot

- Date: 2026-09-09 KST.
- Repository: `/Users/yangseunghyeon/orca/workspaces/OnMaruBE/develop`.
- Current branch: `feature/prd-mvp-implements`.
- Git Flow target: create a PR from `feature/prd-mvp-implements` into `develop`.
- Production branch recorded in `AGENTS.md`: `main`.
- Current work type: backend planning, architecture blueprint, operating harness setup, and documentation. No backend application source code has been scaffolded yet.

## Completed Work

- Added local backend reference links under `docs/`:
  - `docs/backend_schema_design_guide.md` points to `/Users/yangseunghyeon/Development/OnMaru/OnMaru-docs/backend_schema_design_guide.md`.
  - `docs/specs` points to `/Users/yangseunghyeon/Development/OnMaru/OnMaruFE/docs/specs`.
- Initialized project operating docs and agent handoff conventions:
  - `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CLINE.md`.
  - `project-roadmap.md`, `improvements.md`, `handoff.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Added GitHub workflow scaffolding:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
- Added ADR toolkit bootstrap:
  - `.adr-toolkit.json`
  - `docs/decisions/README.md`
  - `docs/decisions/adr-template.md`
  - `docs/decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`
- Prepared backend planning artifacts under `docs/planning/`:
  - `README.md`
  - `architecture-blueprint.md`
  - `backend-prd.md`
  - `data-api-design.md`
  - `issue-plan.md`
  - `work-graph.json`
  - `adr-proposals.md`
  - `adr-scores/*.json`
- Added expanded journey exploration planning under `docs/planning/journey-exploration/`:
  - FE source audit.
  - Brainstorming plus Red/Blue review.
  - Story-linked exploration PRD.
  - Recommendation, Hugging Face candidate, RAG, LangGraph, and harness architecture notes.
  - FE API and SSE handoff draft.
  - 2026 contest scoring review.
  - Implementation impact and issue candidates.
- Updated `docs/database/schema.md` with successor planning context.

## Plugin State

- Local Codex plugin is updated and enabled:
  - Plugin: `agent-toolkit-skills@personal`.
  - Version: `0.3.20+codex.20260909022246`.
  - Enabled skills: 29.
  - Installed skill files checked: 231 files matched local source.
  - Cache root: `/Users/yangseunghyeon/.codex/plugins/cache/personal/agent-toolkit-skills/0.3.20+codex.20260909022246`.
- New sessions should discover the updated plugin automatically.
- `adr-toolkit` is a separate local skill, not part of the `agent-toolkit-skills` plugin bundle.

## Architecture Decisions Drafted, Not Yet Final

- Recommended baseline: Modular Monolith + selective Hexagonal Architecture + Lightweight DDD + Gradle Multi-Module.
- Spring Boot owns business APIs and business transactions.
- FastAPI is treated as an external AI/data-processing system behind Spring output ports.
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS is the current relational database recommendation.
- pgvector and AI indexing are proposed for later stages after source qualification.
- Redis, broker, Neo4j, MSA, and heavy graph database adoption are deferred until evidence justifies them.
- ADR proposals exist in planning docs, but only ADR-0001 process initialization has been formally recorded.

## FE And Data Findings To Preserve

- FE docs and source must remain backend input because they include contracts, wireframes, class diagrams, and current data assumptions.
- FE audit found these important backend implications:
  - `/discover` currently uses local fixed mood plans and timers, not real AI.
  - Graph positions are visual percentages, not geographic coordinates.
  - TOP5 and weekly labels are not backed by verified server-side ranking evidence yet.
  - Hanok monthly content can mismatch fallback place data if source IDs are not normalized.
  - Odii ask API currently expects `{ question, filters }`, so new selected-story APIs must preserve compatibility or provide a clear version.
  - Warmth is currently seeded and localStorage-based; server-side warmth needs truthful provenance.
  - Visitor data is regional and delayed; it must not be described as live POI congestion.
  - A hardcoded FE service-key fallback was observed. Do not copy the key into docs or logs; handle removal and rotation as a separate security task.

## Journey Exploration Proposal

- Working product direction: "이야기길" for the `/discover` experience.
- Core user flow: listen to an Odii or editorial story, discover grounded nearby places, pin one place, then replace alternatives without losing the selected place.
- UI contract direction:
  - Horizontal alternatives.
  - Vertical selected detail.
  - Map as geography.
  - Relation graph as explanation and story connection.
  - Typed UI blocks from backend, not arbitrary frontend code generation.
- Backend direction:
  - Spring creates canonical sessions and validates published content.
  - Python handles bounded AI planning, retrieval, embedding, and LangGraph execution.
  - Spring hydrates AI results against current canonical data before returning to FE.
  - SSE streams progress and typed blocks, with snapshot and replay support.

## Issue Planning State

- Existing `docs/planning/work-graph.json` covers W0-W11 only.
- Journey exploration introduced X0-X8 issue candidates, but they are not merged into `work-graph.json` yet.
- No GitHub Issues have been created from the graph yet.
- No PR had been created before this handoff update.
- Before implementation starts, unify W and X issue candidates, remove overlaps, recalculate dependency waves, then create GitHub Issues with `spec-to-issues`.

## Verification Already Done

- Plugin export and validation completed in the earlier session.
- Planning JSON and Markdown sanity checks were run earlier for the expanded journey docs.
- Existing W graph was checked earlier: no graph errors, but five shared build-file conflict warnings were noted.
- Branch protection could not be verified through the GitHub API because this private repository plan blocks that endpoint.
- Current repository still has no backend build manifest, so CI is limited to documentation and repository hygiene checks.

## Known Gaps

- Two user-mentioned external reference materials were not provided in the session and have not been reviewed.
- Contest track is assumed to be the 2026 development track, but the user must confirm the actual submission track.
- Team, budget, auth provider, deployment target, API quota, data license review, and model budget are unresolved.
- No runtime backend, database migration, OpenAPI generation, SSE server, FastAPI service, model inference, or frontend browser integration test exists yet.
- The expanded FE API handoff is a prose draft, not a validated OpenAPI schema.

## Restart Order For Next Session

1. Run `git status --short --branch` and confirm branch `feature/prd-mvp-implements`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/planning/README.md`, and this `handoff.md`.
3. Confirm whether the user wants to keep the current planning commit as-is or split it into smaller commits.
4. Confirm missing contest track and the two missing reference materials.
5. Unify W0-W11 and X0-X8 into one implementation issue graph.
6. Review and approve ADR proposals before locking architecture decisions.
7. Use `spec-to-issues` to create implementation issues.
8. Start backend scaffold only after W0 source/contracts/auth qualification is clear.

## Git Flow PR Preparation

- Commit this documentation/planning state from `feature/prd-mvp-implements`.
- Push the branch to origin.
- Open a PR into `develop`.
- PR body should state that this is a planning/harness PR, not a backend runtime implementation.
- Required checks should pass before merge.
